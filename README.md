# PythonCourse-code

This repository contains code and resources for my Python course. It is designed for learners to understand and practice Python programming.

---

## Course Content

### 1. **Introduction to Python**
   - Basics of Python programming
   - Setting up your Python environment
   - Writing your first Python program

#### Example:
```python
print("Welcome to Python Programming!")
```

---

### 2. **Variables and Data Types**
   - Learn how to declare and use variables.
   - Explore Python's dynamic typing.

#### Example:
```python
# String variable
name = "Aditya Thakur"

# Integer variable
age = 25

# Float variable
price = 99.99

# Boolean variable
is_student = True

# Output variables
print(name, age, price, is_student)
```

---

### 3. **Control Flow**
   - `if` statements
   - Loops: `for` and `while`

#### Example:
```python
# Example of an if-else statement
if age > 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

# Example of a for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Iteration {i + 1}")
```

---

### 4. **Functions**
   - Writing reusable code with functions.
   - Understanding parameters and return values.

#### Example:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Aditya"))
```

---

### 5. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Learn about classes, objects, and methods.

#### Example:
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def introduce(self):
        return f"My name is {self.name}, and I am {self.age} years old."

student = Student("Aditya", 25)
print(student.introduce())
```

---

### 6. **Advanced Topics**
   - File handling
   - Exception handling
   - Modules and packages

#### Example:
```python
# File handling example
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!")

# Exception handling example
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

---

## Learning Goals
